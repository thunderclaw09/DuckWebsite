# DuckWebsite
This is the code for the ducky website I made in Replit. It's also the first repo I've made that I understand kinda what I'm doing. It's my first official GitHub repository.
If you can see this repository, please send me an issue, as that would mean that something must be modified, whether it be the permissions or this readme. 
The code was created as an exercise after taking the Mike Dane courses, which I would strongly recommend.
